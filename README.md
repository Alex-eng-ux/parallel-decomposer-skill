# parallel-decomposer-skill

This repository contains two related skills:

- `parallel-decomposer-skill`: the original version, optimized for explicit task cards and manual multi-window workflows.
- `parallel-decomposer-auto`: the auto-orchestration version, optimized for runtimes that can dispatch sub-agents or worker threads automatically.

Use the original skill when you want visible worker prompts and manual control. Use the auto version when the runtime can orchestrate parallel workers directly.

## Skills In This Repo

### `parallel-decomposer-skill`

- Splits complex work into structured task cards
- Includes dependency checks, handoff brief generation, and merge guidance
- Works well for manual multi-window or hybrid workflows

### `parallel-decomposer-auto`

- Produces orchestration-ready worker specs instead of emphasizing copy-paste windows
- Assumes automatic sub-agent dispatch when available
- Falls back to manual prompts only when the runtime cannot orchestrate workers

## What It Does

These skills help you break down complex work into 3-7 independent subtasks that can run in parallel. They handle:

- Task analysis: understand the domain, goal, and constraints
- Smart decomposition: split work into independent units
- Dependency detection: avoid hidden ordering or file-ownership conflicts
- Context preservation: keep a shared handoff brief across workers
- Result integration: provide a merge strategy for the final result

## Usage

### Original Skill

```text
/parallel-decomposer Analyze this codebase for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code quality
/parallel-decomposer Write a comprehensive report about AI trends covering technical, business, and ethical aspects
/parallel-decomposer Review this pull request for logic errors, style issues, and documentation completeness
```

### Auto Skill

```text
Use $parallel-decomposer-auto to split this work into orchestration-ready worker specs with a shared handoff brief and merge plan.
```

## How It Works

1. You provide a complex task.
2. The skill analyzes the task and identifies a useful split.
3. The skill creates a shared handoff brief.
4. The runtime dispatches worker specs to sub-agents when supported.
5. Fallback: if automatic dispatch is unavailable, you can still copy prompts manually.
6. The skill provides a merge strategy for the final result.
